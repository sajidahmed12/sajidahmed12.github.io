# About Me

Hi there, I am Md Sajid Ahmed. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at AlterSense Limited. Previously I was a Lab Instructor at the ECE Department at North South University. Taught undergrad Computer Architecture & Database labs. Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the TnR lab. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from North South University, where I was the recipient of the Best Capstone Project of Summer 2019 of the ACM Student Chapterâ€™s Innovation Challenge.

My research interests are broadly in the areas of Machine Learning (Vision & Computer Architecture). My previous research work focused on addressing the use of machine learning in biomedical engineering and natural language processing. 

Currently, I am working on Emerging number formats of GP GPUs and their impact on ML runtime performance under the supervision of Dr. Abdulrahman Mahmoud, Postdoc, Harvard University, USA. My goal for this research is to inspect the faults and issues of current State-of-the-art Object Detection & Semantic Segmentation models and understand their robustness in terms of Golden inference and error injections. 


# Research Interests:

I work in the field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, where I am interested in the following areas:
- Computer Vision (Instance Segmentation, Medical Imaging).
- Computer Architecture in Reliability and Approximate Computing
- NLP (Text-to-Speech Systhesis)

# News:
- [January 2021]: Our manuscript on Blood Glucose Level Regression for Smartphone PPG Signals Using Machine Learning has been Published in MPDI Applied Sciences (**IF 2.7**)
