Hi there, I am Md Sajid Ahmed. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [AlterSense Limited](https://altersense.com/). Previously, I was a Lab Instructor at the ECE Department at [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu). Taught undergrad Computer Architecture & Database labs. Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the TnR lab. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from North South University, where I was the recipient of the Best Capstone Project of Summer 2019 of the ACM Student Chapter’s Innovation Challenge.

My core competencies include object detection, image recognition, machine learning pipelines, and statistical validation. At AlterSense, I work with the Helios team, contributing to various industrial process automation solutions using computer vision and AI. I have built scalable machine learning models for sustainable AI systems, performed analytical validation on ML runtime performance, and created machine learning pipelines for deployment and automation. I am passionate about applying machine learning and computer vision to solve real-world problems and create social impact. I value teamwork, innovation, and education and can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the organization.

I am a machine learning engineer at [AlterSense Limited](https://altersense.com/), working on deep-learning-based worker activity recognition systems for the garment industry in Bangladesh. I received my B.Sc. in CSE from [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I was advised by [Dr.Nabeel Mohammed](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=w5djOYsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) & [Dr. Tanzilur Rahman](https://sites.google.com/site/tanzilctg) from the ECE department at North South University. My bachelor's thesis is titled Road Crack Segmentation with Driving Assistance and Real‑time Feedback System.


My current research focuses on Computer Vision (Instance Segmentation, Medical Imaging) and  Resiliency Analysis of SOTA models in terms of ML runtime performance and accuracy. I am also interested in Biomedical Signal Processing (i.e., PPG, EEG, Speech Synthesis). Feel free to contact me to discuss anything related to computer vision signal processing or some of my projects.
