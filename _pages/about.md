Hi, I am a machine learning engineer at [AlterSense Limited](https://altersense.com/), working on deep-learning-based worker activity recognition systems for the garment industry in Bangladesh. My core competencies include object detection, image recognition, machine learning pipelines, and statistical validation. I received my B.Sc. in CSE from [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I was advised by [Dr.Nabeel Mohammed](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=w5djOYsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) & [Dr. Tanzilur Rahman](https://sites.google.com/site/tanzilctg) from the ECE department at North South University. My bachelor's thesis is titled Road Crack Segmentation with Driving Assistance and Realâ€‘time Feedback System.

My current research focuses on Computer Vision (Instance Segmentation, Medical Imaging) and  Resiliency Analysis of SOTA models in terms of ML runtime performance and accuracy. I am also interested in Biomedical Signal Processing (i.e., PPG, EEG, Speech Synthesis). Feel free to contact me to discuss anything related to computer vision signal processing or some of my projects.
