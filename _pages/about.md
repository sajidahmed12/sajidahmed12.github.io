Hi there, I am Md Sajid Ahmed. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [AlterSense Limited](https://altersense.com/). Previously I was a Lab Instructor at the ECE Department at [North South University](www.northsouth.edu). Taught undergrad Computer Architecture & Database labs. Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the TnR lab. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from North South University, where I was the recipient of the Best Capstone Project of Summer 2019 of the ACM Student Chapterâ€™s Innovation Challenge.

My research interests are broadly in the areas of Machine Learning (Vision & Computer Architecture). My previous research work focused on addressing the use of machine learning in biomedical engineering and natural language processing. 

Currently, I am working on Emerging number formats of GP GPUs and their impact on ML runtime performance under the supervision of [Dr. Abdulrahman Mahmoud](https://ma3mool.github.io/), Postdoc, [Harvard Architecture, Circuits, and Compilers Group!](https://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu/), USA. My goal for this research is to inspect the faults and issues of current State-of-the-art Object Detection & Semantic Segmentation models and understand their robustness in terms of Golden inference and error injections. 


# Research Interests:

I work in the field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision, where I am interested in the following areas:
- Computer Vision (Instance Segmentation, Medical Imaging).
- Computer Architecture (Reliability and Resiliency Analysis of DNNs)
- NLP (Text-to-Speech Systhesis)

# News:
- [January 2021] Our manuscript on Blood Glucose Level Regression for Smartphone PPG Signals Using Machine Learning has been Published in MPDI Applied Sciences (**IF 2.7**)
