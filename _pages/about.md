Hi, I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Kentucky, advised by [Dr. Ruiquan Huang](https://ruiquan5514.github.io/). My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Language Models, with an emphasis on computational efficiency and scalable learning. I am particularly interested in developing efficient training and inference strategies for large-scale generative and language models.

Previously, I worked as a Computer Vision AI Engineer at AlterSense Limited, where I led the development of a deep learning–based human activity recognition system tailored for the ready-made garments (RMG) industry in Bangladesh. During this role, I designed and implemented a temporal action segmentation model based on Video Mamba, achieving approximately ~82% accuracy on proprietary in-house video datasets. My work was supervised by [Dr. Nabeel Mohammed](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=w5djOYsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Prior to this, I served as a Lab Instructor at [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu) for three years, where I mentored undergraduate students across a range of computer science and engineering courses. I was also awarded a research fellowship through the [Fatima Fellowship Program](https://www.fatimafellowship.com/) and worked as a Research Assistant at the [TnR Biomedical Research Lab](https://github.com/TnR-Lab), contributing to projects at the intersection of biomedical signal processing and deep learning.

I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University, advised by [Dr. Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan](https://ece.northsouth.edu/people/dr-mohammad-ashrafuzzaman-khan/) and [Dr. Tanzilur Rahman](https://sites.google.com/site/tanzilctg) from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My undergraduate thesis, titled *Road Crack Segmentation with Driving Assistance and Real-time Feedback System*, focused on applying computer vision for intelligent transportation.

My research interests lie in computer vision, multimodal learning, and generative AI. You can find my resume [here](https://sajidahmed12.github.io/files/Md_Sajid_Ahmed_CV.pdf).
