Hi there, I am Md Sajid Ahmed. I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [AlterSense Limited](https://altersense.com/). Previously, I was a Lab Instructor at the ECE Department at [North South University](https://www.northsouth.edu). Taught undergrad Computer Architecture & Database labs. Before that, I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the TnR lab. I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from North South University, where I was the recipient of the Best Capstone Project of Summer 2019 of the ACM Student Chapterâ€™s Innovation Challenge.

My core competencies include object detection, image recognition, machine learning pipelines, and statistical validation. At AlterSense, I work with the Helios team, contributing to various industrial process automation solutions using computer vision and AI. I have built scalable machine learning models for sustainable AI systems, performed analytical validation on ML runtime performance, and created machine learning pipelines for deployment and automation. I am passionate about applying machine learning and computer vision to solve real-world problems and create social impact. I value teamwork, innovation, and education and can bring diverse perspectives and experiences to the organization.

<!---
Currently, I am working on Emerging number formats of GP GPUs and their impact on ML runtime performance under the supervision of [Dr. Abdulrahman Mahmoud](https://ma3mool.github.io/), Postdoc, [Harvard Architecture, Circuits, and Compilers Group!](https://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu/), The USA. My goal for this research is to inspect the faults and issues of current State-of-the-art Object Detection & Semantic Segmentation models and understand their robustness in terms of Golden inference and error injections.
